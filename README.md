# NeuraLake Open Reasoning UI  
## iSA-02 Interface - Open Source

Welcome to the official interface for iSA-02, the world‚Äôs first **Small Reasoning Model (SRM)**. This interface is designed to simplify the use and integration of the iSA-02 model into various AI applications, leveraging its unique ability for dynamic logical reasoning with support for context windows of up to **256K tokens**.

## üåü **About iSA-02**

iSA-02 redefines the limits of reasoning in AI:  
- Developed from **Llama 3.2 3B** with enhancements based on synthetic datasets from **NeuraLake**.  
- Ability to adjust reasoning as the context window increases or decreases.  
- Available in **F16 (VLLM)** and **GGUF (Hugging Face)** formats.
